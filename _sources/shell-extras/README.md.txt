# UNIX shell

The Software Carpentry Foundation has a great [lesson on the basics of using the
UNIX shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) that we will be using
for the Starterkit course.

Some additional topics can be found at the [more on the UNIX shell webpage](./shell2.md), while this section covers LHCb-specific material.
